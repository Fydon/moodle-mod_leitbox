# Adaptive Review for Moodle

Adaptive Review is an experimental Moodle 5 activity module designed around mastery-based retrieval practice rather than traditional Leitner boxes.

Rather than treating flashcards as fixed-box objects, Adaptive Review tracks individual card mastery and is designed to support reusable card repositories, instructor-created card sets, and adaptive scheduling based on long-term memory research.

## Features

Current prototype includes:

- Modern Vue 3 dashboard
- Individual card mastery tracking
- Set Mastery progress dashboard
- Instructor-defined mastery goals
- Searchable All Cards library
- Retrieval-first review workflow
- "I Know It" / "Not Yet" review interface
- Recently Learned browse and practice modes
- Moodle gradebook integration
- Responsive user interface

## Planned Features

The long-term vision includes:

- Time-based adaptive scheduling engine
- Global card repository
- Reusable card sets across multiple courses
- Shared institutional content libraries
- CSV import/export
- Analytics dashboard
- Instructor authoring tools
- Advanced mastery algorithms
